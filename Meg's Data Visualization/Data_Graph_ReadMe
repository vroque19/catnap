Data Graph: Light, Temperature, and Motion Time Series Plot

Overview:
This Python script visualizes time-series data for light levels, temperature, and motion over a set period. The data is displayed using three separate y-axes, allowing for easy comparison of these variables over time.

Features
Three Y-Axes:
Gold line: Light levels
Red line: Temperature (Â°C)
Blue line: Motion detection (0 = No motion, 1 = Motion detected)
Time as X-Axis: The script plots measurements taken at different time intervals.
Custom Styling: Uses different colors and markers for clarity.
